# Introduction #

YouTube's popular. YouTube's huge. YouTube's the number one video sharing website.

In short, YouTube rocks. How could DamnVid ignore this phenomenon?

YouTube is, after local file conversion, what DamnVid handles best.
To add a YouTube video to DamnVid's video list, click on the "Add URL" button and paste the URL to the YouTube video you want to add.
YouTube videos have a little ![http://damnvid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/img/youtube.png](http://damnvid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/img/youtube.png) icon next to them. DamnVid should auto-detect their title _and_ the highest quality available.

High-definition video support was added in version 0.2.1, and they have a different icon: ![http://damnvid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/modules/youtube/youtubehd.png](http://damnvid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/modules/youtube/youtubehd.png)
In earlier versions, the resulting video will not look as nice as it could, if the video you are trying to convert is HD-enabled.
